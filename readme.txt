The myTreasures project derived from the idea of presenting your own dvd collection nice and informatively in the internet.

== Description ==

myTreasures is a plugin to show your collection of fancy stuff in your wordpress blog. This collection could contain any media you want to.

Here are a few ideas, what you can show in your blog with myTreasures:
*		DVDs
* 	Games for XBox, PlayStation, Dreamcast, PC ...
* 	Music CDs
*		Cars & Bikes
*		Shoes, Clothing
*		And much much more

The best part of myTreasures is the flexibility to show all media / stuff you want. You can create own types with own attributes to show with this plugin. But there are more features myTreasures can offer you:
*		CSV Import of your Database
*		Different categories of stuff with different attributes
*		Tracklist
*		Minigallery for images of your treasure
*		Ratingsystem
*		Many options to setup your installation of myTreasures
*		Export / Import of your myTreasures mySQL database

I could extend this list, but just try it and experience it on your own!
